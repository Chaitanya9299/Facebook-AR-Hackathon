Inspiration
Actually whenever we see stickman its normally on TV or on some YouTube video. But I wanted to fell it in reality (Augmented Reality) and also wanna make it possible for others. To do that I think Instagram is the best platform.

What it does
Will provide an option to users to see stickman in AR

How we built it
Made it Using SparkAR Studio and maxima. Also some modifications in the blender.

Challenges we ran into
Actually the big challenge was to learn SparkAR Studio as we never used it and while installing it had to face many difficulties.

What we learned
Learned to use SparkAR as it was our first time.

What's next for Stickman (Augmented Reality)
We will try to add more characters

Built With
